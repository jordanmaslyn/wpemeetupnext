# Next.js Headless WordPress Getting Started Example

## Setup

Talk with Alex Moon if you need access to the dev environment in WPE. You can point this to that instance @ https://meetupdev.wpengine.com

If you clone that local you may need to define `GOOLE_MAPS_API_KEY` in `wp-config.php` to enable the google Maps integration in WP.

Checkout the [.env.local.sample](./.env.local.sample) for setting environment variables for the Next app. 


## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

[http://localhost:3000]()
